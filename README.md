⚠️ Important Warning:
DO NOT RUN CODE ON YOUR MACHINE THAT YOU HAVE NOT AUDITED FIRST! While the provided code is safe, it's essential to follow the adage: "Verify, don't trust." Always review any code before running it, especially on a machine that holds your wallet. The last thing we want is a repeat of the hack that occurred earlier this year.


To run, use `python3 batch_unstake.py --coldkey xxxx`
